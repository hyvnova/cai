# Fix GCC-14 breakage in onig_sys / oniguruma

[patch.crates-io]
# Pull the crate directly from the repo’s master branch, which
# already vendors Oniguruma 6.9.10 (the first release that compiles
# clean under the new strict C rules).  Once crates.io publishes
# a `69.9.*` tag you can delete this whole section.
